# nxGraphAlgorithms
This is a major class project designed to demonstrate our understanding of graph theory and implementing it into Python applications through the use of algorithms and the popular framework Networkx

Project Structure:
- main.py: holds the code for testing of functions implementation. It is used for testing only and is therefore blank
- greedy_coloring.py: holds the code for the greedy color function
- hakumi.py
- independence.py: functions related to finding independence
- prism.py: holds the WIP code for the final project
- functions: folder holding all the important basic functions that was done in class
- graph_library: folder holding all the test graph files
